No adoptable dog or cat in San Francisco goes without a home, even if they have medical or other issues.In 2014 we merged with Pets Unlimited, a likeminded animal welfare nonprofit in Pacific Heights. Their organization included a nonprofit veterinary hospital that provided significant financial assistance to pet guardians in need, as well as a small adoption center. The original SF SPCA campus in the Mission, and the additional campus in Pacific Heights, are now working toward the same shared mission and goals.We imagine a community where every animal has a loving home. Where animals donâ€™t need the support of San Franciscoâ€™s rescues and shelters. And we know how to get there.
